Date, Time & Place.

The workshop takes place from Tuesday (14.01.2020) until Friday (17.01.2020), starting at 09:00 and ending around 16:00.
All workshop sessions will take place in the JenTower at the 8th floor (Leutragraben 1, 07743 Jena; https://goo.gl/maps/Wi3LcBYNkF345rPJ9) 

How to exactly get to the Workshop room.
------
When entering the JenTower, continue to the elevators were you will find a terminal. There you enter the number **'8'** to get to the 8th floor. The terminal will display either the letter **'B'**, **'C'** or **'D'**, indicating which of the elevators you have to enter and will bring you to the 8th floor. 
In case you are stopped and asked where you want to go at the JenTower's reception near the elevators, you can simply answer that you are expected at the bioinformatics lab on the 8th floor for a workshop.

Own preparations.
------
**Please bring your own laptop for the practical hands-on sessions each day.** 

During the first two days, we will mainly work with the online platform **galaxy**. At https://usegalaxy.org/ you can create an account for free to use this service. Don't worry if you have never worked with **galaxy** before, you will get an introduction for the basic functionalities by us.

During the last two days, we will work mainly with **BEAST 2**, which you can download from their official site at http://www.beast2.org/. However, before installing **BEAST 2**, make sure that you have Java 8 (or higher, but 8 is ideal) installed on your laptop, which you can get here: https://adoptopenjdk.net/. After successfully having installed **BEAST 2**, some more internal packages are required, namely:

* BEASTLabs
* BDSKY
* bacter
* Tracer
* FigTree
* DensiTree

Installing these additional packages is made easy by the **BEAST 2 Package Manager**, which is part of **BEAST 2**’s graphical user interface, just follow the [Managing Packages](http://www.beast2.org/managing-packages/index.html) page for details.

If you have any trouble with the installation of **BEAST 2** or some of the additional packages, don't worry. We can help you with the installation also during the workshop.

A few more details about the schedule of the workshop.

We will start each day with a theoretical session that will go from 09:00 to about 12:00. After a refreshing lunch break, the practical hands-on session will take place in the afternoon from 13:00 until around 16:00. Since we are located in the city centre, you are free to go to the Abbe-Mensa for lunch, or just any other nearby location that suits your taste best.
